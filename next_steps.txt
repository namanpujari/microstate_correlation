1.  Verification function

	2 dictionaries.
	First should be update to head3.lst update in microstate_analysis
	so that the dictionary ALSO contains occupancies. head3.lst already has
	the conformer ids.

	update my own classs to take in fort.38, converts into dictionary where keys
	are conformer ids and the values are occupancies. This will be checked against
	the dictionary created in the previous step
	
	can return list of ids that do not match up, list of ids that match up (in terms of matching occupancies) 
	and list of missing ids
	
2.  Expand trajectory based on state count next to each record.
	
	E.g. if we have [1, 32 ... 43, 21, 31] then 2 as state count then the trajectory
	would be expanded into 
	
	[[1, 32 ... 43, 21, 31]
	 [1, 32 ... 32, 21, 31]]

step2 out check if different chains have different ids
