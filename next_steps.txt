1.  Verification function

	Need to add two dicts:

	conf to id
	id to conf

	(key to value)
	^ format
	
	can return list of ids that do not match up, list of ids that match up (in terms of matching occupancies) 
	and list of missing ids


	
2.  Expand trajectory based on state count next to each record.
	
	E.g. if we have [1, 32 ... 43, 21, 31] then 2 as state count then the trajectory
	would be expanded into 
	
	[[1, 32 ... 43, 21, 31]
	 [1, 32 ... 32, 21, 31]]

In order to complete the second part of step 1. a useful method can be to create two parallel dictionaries.
1 maps id to conf name and the other maps conf name to id

step2 out check if different chains have different ids
